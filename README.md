## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./images/screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Front-end development requires patience and crativity. By developing this site I learned many aspects of web development. I have applied bootstrap framework's various components and style to achieve the desired output.  I have applied diffrent Bootstrap classes like .container, .bg-info, .d-flex .flex-column .min-vh-100 .justify-content-center .align-items-center, card etc. to make the page as expected.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

```Bootstrap
<div class="container bg-info">
```

### Continued development

I would like to make the site dynamic by adding more content and functionalities.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Boostrap is a css framework and this site has helped me applying robust css styles.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - W3Schools is the first point of reference for every developer. This website has a plethora of tutorials on almost every subjects in front-end and back-end development.  I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
